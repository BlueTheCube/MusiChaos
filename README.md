# MusiChaos

A mindustry mod that allows you to add your own ambient, dark and boss music.

## HowTo

MusiChaos creates a directory named `musichaos` within the data directory. This is where you put your music tracks.

You can specify where the track should be.

`ambientmus-` indicates that the track should be in the ambient music group.

`darkmus-` indicates that the track should be in the dark music group.

`bossmus-` indicates that the track should be in the boss music group.

If a track does not contain any of these, it is an unspecified track. These tracks can either be ignored or put in a random music group.

If you add new tracks while the game is active, you can load them by reloading the tracks in the mod settings.
